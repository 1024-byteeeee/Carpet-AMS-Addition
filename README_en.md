## Notes

- Use as higher version of required mods as possible.
- Rules with ðŸ’» emoji present that correctly executing these rules requires Carpet-AMS-Addition on the client side.
- Even some functions are provided by Carpet-AMS-Addition, we, AMS Server, will not use these function in our survival server.
- For Carpet-AMS-Addition whose version is older than v1.11.2 (For Minecraft 1.19.2 or 1.19.3, it's v1.5.3), there exists a fatal bug [issue#25](https://github.com/Minecraft-AMS/Carpet-AMS-Addition/issues/25). If now you are still using old version of mod mentioned above, please update your Carpet-AMS-Addition immediately to at lease version v1.11.2 (for 1.19.2/1.19.3, the bug-fix version is v1.5.3).
